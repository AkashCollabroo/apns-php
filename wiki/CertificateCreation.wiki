#summary How to create a Push Notification certificate in iPhone Developer Program Portal
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

To send Push notification to an application/device couple you need an unique device token (see the [http://code.google.com/p/apns-php/wiki/ObjectiveC ObjectiveC page]) and a certificate.

== Generate a Push Certificate ==

To generate a certificate on a *Mac OS X*:
  # Log-in to the [http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/overview/index.action iPhone Developer Program Portal]
  # Choose *App IDs* from the menu on the right ([http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/bundles/index.action or click here])
  # Create an App ID without a wildcard. For example {{{3L223ZX9Y3.com.armiento.test}}}
  # Click the *Configure* link next to this App ID and then click on the button to start the wizard to generate a new *Development Push SSL Certificate* ([http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/ProvisioningDevelopment/ProvisioningDevelopment.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH104-SW4 Apple Documentation: Creating the SSL Certificate and Keys])
  # Download this certificate and double click on {{{aps_developer_identity.cer}}} to import it into your Keychain
  # Launch *Keychain Assistant* (located in Application, Utilities or search for it with Spotlight) and click on My Certificates on the left
  # Expand *Apple Development Push Services* and select Apple Development Push Services *AND* your private key (just under Apple Development Push Services)
  # Right-click and choose "Export 2 elements..." and save as {{{server_cerificates_bundle_sandbox.p12}}} (don't type a password).
  # Open *Terminal* and change directory to location used to save {{{server_cerificates_bundle_sandbox.p12}}} and convert the PKCS12 certificate bundle into PEM format using this command (press _enter_ when asked for _Import Password_):
{{{
openssl pkcs12 -in server_cerificates_bundle_sandbox.p12 -out server_cerificates_bundle_sandbox.pem -nodes -clcerts
}}}
  # Now you can use this PEM file as your certificate in ApnsPHP!

== Verify peer using Entrust Root Certification Authority ==

Download the Entrust Root Authority certificate *directly from Entrust Inc. website*:
 # Navigate to https://www.entrust.net/downloads/root_index.cfm
 # Choose "Personal Use"
 # Download the Entrust CA (2048) file (entrust_2048_ca.cer) [https://www.entrust.net/downloads/binary/entrust_2048_ca.cer] for the *Sandbox environment*; download the Entrust Secure Server CA file (entrust_ssl_ca.cer) [https://www.entrust.net/downloads/binary/entrust_ssl_ca.cer] for the *Production environment* _until December 22nd_ (*after December 22nd, 2010 you have to use entrust_2048_ca.cer also for the Production Environment* as Apple said: _"To ensure you can continue to validate your server's connection to the Apple Push Notification service, you will need to update your push notification server with a copy of the 2048-bit root certificate from Entrust's website."_).
If you want to use the same file for the Sandbox and the Production environment please concat the two certificates. For example:
{{{
wget https://www.entrust.net/downloads/binary/entrust_2048_ca.cer -O - > entrust_root_certification_authority.pem
echo >> entrust_root_certification_authority.pem
wget https://www.entrust.net/downloads/binary/entrust_ssl_ca.cer -O - >> entrust_root_certification_authority.pem
}}}

Otherwise (_for use *only* in a Mac OS X environment_), export the Entrust Root Authority certificate:
  # Launch *Keychain Assistant* (located in Application, Utilities or search for it with Spotlight) and click on System Root Certificate on top-left and Certificates on the bottom-left
  # Right-click on *Entrust Root Certification Authority* and export with {{{entrust_root_certification_authority.pem}}} file name and choose as document format *Privacy Enhanced Mail (.pem)*.
  # Now you can use this PEM file as Entrust Root Certification Authority in ApnsPHP to verify Apple Peer!
